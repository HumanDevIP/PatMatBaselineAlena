{"text":"The system of claim 13 wherein the centerfrequencytobandwidthmapping employs a table lookup and the information provided to the mobile station via downlink signaling is in a broadcasting channel or preamble and is transmitted within the coreband.","text_b":"The general principles of FFTbased OFDM signal transmission can be described with reference to FIG.1 representing a block diagram of a typical OFDM transmission engine.The OFDM transmission engine 10 receives a data stream 12 from a source.A Forward Error Correction FEC block 14 receives that input data stream and applies a coding scheme to introduce errorcorrecting andor errordetecting redundancy into the data stream.As FEC coding typically spans the set of OFDM subcarriers an OFDM system can take advantage of frequency diversity to mitigate losses due to frequency selective fading.Immediately after FEC coding a spectrum builder block 16 divides the sequence of coded bits into segments of mM bits which is further subdivided into M subsegments of m bits M number of modulated carriers.Each subsegment of m bits is mapped to a complex number according to a given signal constellation rule.For example quadrature phase shift keying QPSK with m2 or any 2mary quadrature amplitude modulation QAM scheme such as 16QAM m4 and 64QAM m6.The length M set of mbit data symbols will be employed to modulate M OFDM subcarriers.The set of M data symbols are written to a length N sequence N total number of subcarriers initially filled with zeros MN.Each position of the length N sequence uniquely represents a single OFDM subcarrier.Some of the positions can be occupied by a set of Mpilot values commonly referred to as pilot tones known to the OFDM receiver in order to assist it to overcome channel impairments.The remaining N MMpilot positions remain as zero values to represent blank carriers.Such blank carriers are useful to set a frequency guard space between adjacent channels or subchannels to avoid mutual interference.After spectrum building 16 each successive sequence of N complex values generated from successive segments of mM coded bits are Inverse Fast Fourier Transformed IFFT in IFFT block 18.This modulates the set of N complex values onto the N OFDM subcarriers.By dividing the input data stream into N subcarriers the symbol duration T will be become long relative to that of the multipath delay spread.As a result the problem of multipath induced intersymbol interference ISI is substantially reduced for an OFDMsystem.To almost completely eliminate intersymbol interference a guard time is introduced for each OFDM symbol.This guard time usually takes the form of a cyclic extension of the OFDM symbol.For example L samples at the beginning of the N sample OFDM symbol can be copied to the end of the symbol.This procedure is denoted in Cyclic Extension block 20.This serves to lengthen each baseband OFDM symbol to NL samples.The overall OFDM symbol duration becomes TOFDMTTGuard where TGuard is the duration of the guard interval of L baseband samples.After adding the cyclic extension the baseband OFDM symbol undergoes filtering and upconversion 22 to convert the baseband waveform to an appropriate intermediate frequency IF form prior to conversion to a radio frequency RF form suitable for transmission.","label":null}
